* Emacs terminology

[[https://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png][How to Learn Emacs]]

- buffer :: The area containing text kinda like a *tab in a browser*
- point :: The *cursor*
- window :: A section of the emacs window containing text
  - seperated by splits
- frame :: Dedicated Emacs Window (meaning your OS's window)
- minibuffer :: Text area at the bottom of a frame

- mark :: The point where highlighted text starts
  - the mark is set with ~C-SPC~
- region :: area between the point and the mark (often highlighted)
  - ~kill-region~ (C-w) makes use of this


- Major Mode :: current programming language
- Minor Mode :: (enabled feature such as spellchecking)

* Basic Syntax
- Calling functions
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-add-function (num)
    (+ num 1))

  (my-add-function 1)
  #+end_src
  2


Alternatively we can use ~funcall~ 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(funcall 'my-add-function 1)
#+end_src
2

** Symbols
You can see that I put a quote before the ~my-add-function~

This quote is basically a way to prevent evaluation of ~my-add-function~

if we evaluated my-add-function it would look it up as if it was a
variable.

To give the symbol ~my-add-function~ it's self we need to quote it.

Symbols are often used in place of where some languages would rely on
a string.

I go into this a little more in my video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocDm4zzToo][LEARN EMACS LISP - Mostly The Strange Parts - YouTube]]

* Basic Types
Evaluate each of these with =C-x C-e=

- numbers :: 1
- strings :: "hello"
- symbols :: 'hello
- keywords :: :hello
- chars :: ?h
- true :: t
- false :: nil
- pairs (cons cell) :: (cons 1 2)
- lists :: (list 1 2 3)

** Quote
Quote as in ' tells Emacs not to evaluate the following expression

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
'(+ 1 2)
#+end_src
(+ 1 2)


We used quote to create the symbol above.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
'i-am-a-symbol
#+end_src
i-am-a-symbol

for example if we evaluate ~(list 1 2)~ we get ~(1 2)~

Using quote we can prevent evaluation and skip the use of =list= all together

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
'(1 2)
#+end_src
(1 2)


This is why you may hear people say that in lisp _code is data_

This can also be done for something like a cons cell to skip the use of =cons=
in =(cons 1 2)=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
'(1 . 2)
#+end_src

Note that ~(1 . 2)~ is how a cons cell is represented

** Quasiquote

In addition to the regular quote emacs has a special version of it
called quasiquote which allows us to unquote and experession.

Here is a quick example

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
`(1 2 ,(+ 1 2))
#+end_src

Note that we use =`= as quasiquote rather than ='= and =,= to unquote

* Some quick practical examples
** Interactive functions
All commands you can use (seen with ~M-x~) are functions

They require the use of ~(interactive)~ inside the functon to tell emacs
it can be used as a command.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun insert-numbers ()
  "inserts an a sequence of numbers"
  (interactive)
  (insert "1 2 3"))
#+end_src
insert-numbers
insert-numbers


These interactive functions can be accessed via a keybinding

The string at the top is simply for documentation purposes

To learn more about a function you can use
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(describe-function 'insert-numbers)
#+end_src

This is also available via ~M-x~
** Key Binding
The most general way to bind a new key is using ~global-set-key~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-s") 'insert-numbers) ;; control shift s
#+end_src
insert-numbers

~kbd~ here turns our string into something Emacs can convert into a key

If you are using a more modern Emacs you can skip the ~kbd~ step by using

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(keymap-global-set "C-S-s" 'insert-numbers)
#+end_src
insert-numbers

I will stick to the functions prefixed with keymap for now as they 
often you want keys to be set only for a specific mode

for example lets say we want a key that will insert an if statement in C

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun c--insert-if ()
  (interactive)
  (insert "if () {\n}"))
(keymap-set c-mode-map "C-S-l" 'c--insert-if)
#+end_src
c--insert-if

Now if I open a C file

#+begin_src C
if () {
}
#+end_src

There is a corresponding *map* for basically every mode in Emacs simply
by following the name of the mode with ~-map~

If I would like to learn more about a key I can use

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(describe-key (kbd "C-S-s"))
#+end_src

Alternatively ~C-h k~ then press the key it's self
* Namespaceing

Since all function names are shared in Emacs packages prefix their
functions with the name of the package as to avoid confusion and
conflicting names

for example

~org--newline~

is a function used by org-mode to create a newline

the ~--~ is to indicate it's only meant to be used by org-mode internally

~org-babel-tangle-file~
On the other hand is intended to be used by anyone which is why there is only a single ~-~

* More Emacs lisp features
** Conditionals
*** if
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(if t
    'it-was-true
  'it-was-false)
#+end_src
it-was-true

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(if nil
    'it-was-true
  'it-was-false)
#+end_src
it-was-false

As mentioned above we often use =t= to mean true but really anything
other than =nil= is considered true

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(if 'this-is-true
    'it-was-true
  'it-was-false)
#+end_src
*** when and unless
Often =if= expressions can be difficult to read so when you only need to
handle when something is true we use =when=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when t
  'this-is-true)
#+end_src

If we want to handle the case that something is nil we use unless
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless nil
  'this-is-false)
#+end_src
this-is-false

*** and, or, not
Like in many other languages we can use =and=, =or=, and =not=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(and t nil)
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(and t t)
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(or t nil)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(not t)
#+end_src
*** progn
In Elisp the last expression to be evaluated is returned.

While nice in most cases it can be a pain when we want to perform a
sequence of operations in an =if= expression.

This is solved with =progn=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(if t
    (progn
      (message "print this in minibuffer")
      'this-was-true)
  'this-was-false)
#+end_src
this-was-true

This is another reason people tend to use =when= and =unless=

** Variables
Configuration of Emacs is often done via variables.
*** How do you find these variables? search
~C-h v~
~M-x describe-variable~
*** Setting Variables

- =setq=
  - =setopt= (has extra features e.g. type checking)
    - These types come from [[file:~/.emacs.d/elpa/markdown-mode-20240107.831/markdown-mode.el::(defcustom markdown-command-needs-filename nil][defcustom]]
- =defvar= (For creating new variables)
  - e.g. ~(defvar thing 1 "Just some thing")~

*** Lists (the most important collection)
- cons cells
- cons, car, and cdr

Recall the type *cons cell* ~(cons 1 2)~

which is basically a pair in most other languages

*Lists* _are_ actually constructed using *cons cells*

Chaining these pairs together we can create a list like so

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(cons 1 (cons 2 nil))
#+end_src

As you can see a list is simply a chain of cons cells ending with ~nil~
* Iteration
Each of these you can learn about using =C-h f= or =M-x describe-function=

- cl-loop :: Probably the most familiar to those coming from other languages
     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (require 'cl-lib) ; Usually already required in your config anyways
     (cl-loop for i from 0 to 10
              collect (* i i))
     #+end_src
     (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100)

  - I have a video that goes much deeper into it's use

- while
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq my/val 1)
  (setq my/truth t)
  (while my/truth
    (if (= my/val 10)
        (setq my/truth nil))
    (message "%s" (setq my/val (1+ my/val))))
  #+end_src
  nil

  - dotimes
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq total nil)
    (dotimes (i 3)
      (setq total (cons total i)))
    total
    #+end_src

  - dolist
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq total 0)
    (dolist (i '(1 2 3))
      (setq total (+ total i)))
    total
    #+end_src
    6

* Hooks
One thing new comers often get confused by is hooks

A *hook* is a list of functions to run in a particular situation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-fun ()
  (interactive)
  ;does something
  (run-hooks 'my-fun-hook))

(add-hook 'my-fun-hook (lambda () (insert "3")))
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'my-fun-hook (lambda () (insert "4")))
#+end_src

if you are coming from vim these are similar to *autocommands* but less finicky

One example usecase would be to change settings for a particular programming language

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                  (indent-tabs-mode -1)))
#+end_src

This means that whenever I open an emacs lisp file it will use _spaces instead of tabs_ when I *hit the TAB key*

* Temporary Variables
When you want a function local variable people usually use =let=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun what-is-2+2-5 ()
  (let (
        (four (+ 2 2))
        (five 5)
        )
    (- four five)))

;; call this function
(what-is-2+2-5)
#+end_src
