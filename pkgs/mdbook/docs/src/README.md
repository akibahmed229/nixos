# Welcome to My Learning Journal

This is my personal collection of notes, guides, and cheat sheets on various topics in technology. I created this as a quick reference for myself and to share knowledge with others.

This site is automatically built and deployed from my [NixOS configuration repository](https://github.com/akibahmed229/nixos) using Nix and mdBook.
